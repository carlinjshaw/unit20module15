# 🐛 Fix Non-functional REST API Routes

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on feedback routes via the REST API.

## Expected Behavior

When a user sends a request to the REST API, the appropriate response should be returned, allowing for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on feedback.

## Actual Behavior

The REST API routes don't function correctly, resulting in errors or a lack of a response when requests are sent.

## 💡 Hints

* Have you checked whether the routes are correctly defined in your Express application?

* You will be primarily working in the following files:

  * server/src/routes/api/feedback-routes.ts

  * client/src/api/feedbackAPI.tsx
